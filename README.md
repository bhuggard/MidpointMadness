# MidpointMadness
A fun take on over/under passing yards betting that forces players to pick 1 or more quarterbacks to throw for more and 1 or more to throw for less yards than your chosen signal caller, it has to balance out (if you choose 2 under you must choose 2 over, etc.). Overlapping odds determined using Monte Carlo simulations with custom boostrapped curves for each team. It's Midpoint Madness! (name being workshopped)
